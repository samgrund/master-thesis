# Satellite tools

Currently contains code to find times at which a satellite can be observered in the sense that it is both over the horizon from a given observer, and is illuminated.

Check out https://github.com/samgrund/master-thesis/blob/SatelliteTools/SatelliteWork/Illuminated_Observations/work.ipynb to see how to use it.
